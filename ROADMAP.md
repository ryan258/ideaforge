## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the core functionality for The Crucible, The Mold, The Forge, and The Anvil stages of the IdeaForge process. The application can now generate ideas, create personas, suggest directions, and refine ideas based on AI input and persona feedback. We've also established a robust state management system, error handling for AI interactions, and improved the user experience with markdown rendering and loading indicators.

- [ ] Add export options for completed ideas

### Enhanced AI Integration
- [ ] Improve prompt engineering for more accurate results
- [ ] Implement fallback options for AI service unavailability
- [ ] Add support for multiple AI models (OpenAI, Claude)

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Enhance accessibility features across all components
- [ ] Add a tutorial or onboarding process for new users

### Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
