## State Management

Use Pinia for state management. Create a store in `src/stores/ideaForge.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export const useIdeaForgeStore = defineStore('ideaForge', {
  state: () => ({
    currentStep: 'crucible',
    originalIdea: '',
    currentIdea: '',
    selectedPersonas: [],
    chosenDirection: null,
    currentIteration: null,
    socialMediaIdeas: []
  }),
  actions: {
    // Define actions here
  },
  getters: {
    // Define getters here
  }
})
```

## AI Model Integration - âœ… Implemented

AI model factory implemented in `src/utils/aiModelFactory.ts`:

```typescript
class AIModelFactory {
  getModel(modelName: string) {
    switch (modelName) {
      case 'ollama':
        return new OllamaModel()
      case 'openai':
        return new OpenAIModel()
      case 'claude':
        return new ClaudeModel()
      default:
        throw new Error('Invalid model name')
    }
  }
}
```

## Development Practices

1. Use Composition API and `<script setup>` in Vue components
2. Implement class-based syntax for complex components
3. Use TypeScript for type safety
4. Apply SOLID principles
5. Use dependency injection with `provide`/`inject`
6. Create base classes for shared functionality
7. Use Single-File Components (SFCs)
8. Implement lazy loading for routes
9. Use computed properties for complex calculations
10. Implement error handling and logging
11. Use environment variables for configuration
12. Implement code splitting and tree-shaking
13. Use ESLint with Vue plugin
14. Implement accessibility practices
15. Use Teleport for modals and popups

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests: Use Vitest

   ```
   npm install --save-dev vitest @vue/test-utils
   ```

2. E2E Tests: Use Cypress
   ```
   npm install --save-dev cypress
   ```

## Performance Considerations

1. Use `keep-alive` for caching components
2. Implement debouncing for user inputs
3. Optimize API calls
4. Monitor and optimize component re-renders

## Security Measures

1. Implement input sanitization
